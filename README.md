Our Task:

We created a simple application that allows users to track and record certain information about the hike or trail they visit. Users can also add new hikes or trails, give stats and leave comments on their experience. Our web application requires users to create a profile before logging in. Once logged in they can pick or create a trail/hike and leave comments for fellow hikers. Once a trail or hike is completed, those items will be saved to the database where information can be viewed on the homepage dashboard. 

User Story:

AS A hiker
I WANT a hike tracking and trail finding site/app
SO THAT I can record my hikes and trails viseted and can share my hikes and comments with fellow hikers.

As an outdoors enthusiast, I want to be able to choose a hike or trail in my area, view stats such as elevation, location and distance. After completing a hike or trail I want to be able to add the time it took to complete, the distance of the trail or hike and leave a comment on my experience.
